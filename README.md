The BEST way to play your retro game library.

Wiki & Guides to hosting and creating a library: [wiki](https://github.com/Cattn/GBAv3/wiki)

## Creating a Library
We offer a tool to automatically generate the required files when hosting a library to be added.

### Prerequisites:

* Download the latest release of the Library Creation Tool from the releases tab [here](https://github.com/Cattn/GBA2.0/releases/latest)
* Have a Retro Game library, organized into folders by console
> You can name the folders whatever you like.

### Run
``py tool.py``
> Ensure this tool is run in the same directory that contains all of your game folders (and only those folders)
